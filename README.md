This repository contains my portfolio for my application for a masters in game design
#Detailed Description
This program emulates 5 sort algorithms and 2 search algorithms in a single C++ console application, done through visual studio.
Each algorithm is set up as a class that can be included in the main program with both a .cpp and a .h file in order to simplify the main code and have some reusability.
The Sort Algorithms are:
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort
4. MergeSort
5. Quicksort
and the Search Algorithms:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search done recursively.

The Main program is a menu-driven program which loops over and over until the user chooses to exit or the program encounters an error.

The .exe file built through Visual studio is available in SearchSort\x64\Debug
